<h1>My Past Summer Travels</h1>

<p>
This past summer, I spent six weeks interning in Bangalore, India. Here you will find some information about the different cities I visited. If you get the chance to visit India, I highly recommend you visiting these cities.

<p>
Goa is located on the west coast of India, along the Arabian Sea. It was a Portuguese colony until 1961. The city is known for its unique blend of Indian and Portuguese culture. It has become a popular tourist spot because of its beautiful beaches. If you enjoy heights, this is also a great place to try paragliding! The view I got to see from up in the sky as I sailed across the sky during sunset was truly spectacular. The food was great and the people I met were extremely friendly. </p>


<p>
 Mysore is a historical city in India that use to be the capital of the Mysore Kingdom from 1399 to 1947. One of its famous landmark is the Mysore Palace, which was built in 1912. Each week, there is a light show at the palace. For those that are interested in yoga, Mysore is also a very popular spot in India for Yogis to practice yoga.

<p>
Hampi is a ancient city known for its numerous temple ruins dating back to the Vijayanagara Empire. It is also a UNESCO world heritage site. In addition to having many temples, there are also a variety of shrines, structures, and complexes. If you are on a tight budget but still want to see amazing sights in India, Hampi is a great choice. The cheapest method to get there is by bus and India has some very comfortable overnight sleeper buses to choose from.
